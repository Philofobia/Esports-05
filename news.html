        <h2 class="title">CRL World Championship Primer</h2>
        <p class="content">
          With the final Last Chance Qualifiers (LCQ) wrapped up, we've got all
          16 teams qualified to compete in the CRL World Championship from June
          3-5, for their share of the $75,000 in scholastic awards as well as
          the title of CRL World Champion!
        </p>
        <h3 class="mini-title">What's the Format?</h3>
        <p class="content">
          The CRL World Championship is a 16-team tournament with 10 teams
          representing North American universities and six teams representing
          European universities. You can find those teams below:
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          <strong>North America</strong>: Cégep de Valleyfield, Columbia
          College, Northwood University, Oakland University, Pennsylvania State
          University, St. Clair College, Stockton University, University of
          Central Florida, University of Nevada Las Vegas, University of Texas
          at Arlington.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          <strong>Europe</strong>: Keele University, Karlsruhe Institute of
          Technology, Technical University of Berlin, University of Hamburg,
          University of Portsmouth, University of Salford.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          The 16 teams will be divided into four groups of four for the Group
          Stage. Within each group, teams will be competing in a
          Double-Elimination, GSL-style bracket, with each match played in the
          Group Stage being Best-of-5 (BO5). The Group Stage will be played out
          over the first two days of competition on June 3 and 4.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          The eight teams that survive the Group Stage will then be seeded into
          an eight-team, Single-Elimination Bracket. The Quarterfinals will be
          BO5 series, while the Semifinals and Grand Finals will all be a
          Best-of-7 (BO7) series. The entire bracket will be played on the
          third—and final—day of the tournament. The winners will be crowned the
          first-ever CRL World Champions!

            2022 CRL Spring: Additional Details & CRL World Championship Update
          </h2>
          <p class="content">
            With the Collegiate Rocket League (CRL) Spring Season underway,
            here's an overview of what's ahead for the league as we work towards
            the first-ever CRL World Championship. CRL has grown tremendously
            over the last five years, and we’re happy to announce new partners
            that will help us push the league even further.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Our partners over at eFuse have been working with us and the CCA for
            months, and now we’re working with them to help expand the
            opportunities we provide for students and universities. They’ll help
            us scale up scholastic operations, create content, run an internship
            program, and expand our reach to bring CRL to the next level.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Meanwhile, our European community partner spearheading
            university-level Rocket League in Europe is UniRocketeers. With a
            history of community collaboration and grassroots organizing, we
            believe that UniRocketeers shares our community-first approach and
            that they'll truly help expand our league to more students
            worldwide. We’re excited to see which European Universities show up
            to try and take down CRL’s best! You can read more about the
            European University Rocketeers Championship (EURC) here.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            We’re not quite ready to reveal the location of the CRL World
            Championship just yet, but we can tell you that it'll be taking
            place from June 3-5, 2022. 16 total teams will be joining us from
            across North America and Europe to compete for their chance to win
            the first-ever CRL World Championship.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            If you want to take your shot at becoming one of those 16 teams, be
            sure to play in partner leagues that'll provide invites to the North
            American Last-Chance Qualifier (LCQ) for the CRL World Championship.
            The LCQ is a 56 team double elimination bracket that will take place
            on May 2-5. The top four teams from the LCQ will qualify for the CRL
            World Championship!
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Be sure to watch the best students from both NA and EU compete for
            their invite to the CRL World Championship!

        <p class="content">
          Effective as of March 19, Russia will be added to the list of
          countries where players are ineligible to win cash prizes in the
          Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) and European University
          Rocketeer Championship (EURC) tournaments. Players can still
          participate in these tournaments, but will be unable to win cash
          prizes.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Players residing in Russia must claim their winnings for any previous
          tournaments and claim funds from Psyonix’s payment provider before
          March 22, 2022.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          If cash prizes remain unclaimed after March 22, 2022, they will be
          frozen until Psyonix’s payment service provider is able to resume
          prizing support for players residing in Russia.
