              Psyonix had observed the popularity of Rocket League matches on Twitch
              and other live streaming platforms by early 2016 and were looking to
              use the game more in Esports. In March 2016, Psyonix announced the
              first Rocket League Championship Series; the finals took place in June
              2016 with a US$55,000 prize pool. The second season of the
              championship series took place in December 2016 with a $125,000 prize
              pool. A third series began in March 2017, with the $300,000 prize pool
              finals taking place three months later. In this season, two teams from
              the oceanic region were also invited to compete.
            </p>
            <p class="description-about-us">
              A second division, the Rocket League Rival Series (RLRS), was added in
              Season 4. The two teams finishing at the bottom of the RLCS and the
              two teams finishing at the top of the RLRS for each region play each
              other in a promotion tournament at the end of the season to determine
              if teams are promoted or relegated. At the advent of Season 5 in June
              2018, Psyonix organised and managed the event alone. Previous to this,
              they partnered with Twitch. Season 6 started in September 2018 and
              featured a $1,000,000 prize pool. For Season 7, Psyonix introduced
              South America as a new region. Season 8 took place in December 2019.
              The Season 9 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
              with winners of the regional championships being considered the
              champions. In July 2020, Psyonix announced a new format for the tenth
              season of RLCS, known as RLCS X. This format did away with league play
              and the RLRS in favor of teams earning points through three regional
              splits, all culminating in three seasonal majors.

            <p class="description-about-us">
              The 2021–22 season began in October 2021, bringing in four new regions
              (Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific North, Asia Pacific South,
              and Sub-Saharan Africa), a more reliable circuit similar to Season X,
              and a $6 million prize pool.
