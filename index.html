          Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published
          by Psyonix. Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars",
          Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of the two
          teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their
          opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game
          includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both
          locally and online, including cross-platform play between all
          versions.

          Rocket League has a relatively prominent esports scene, so there are a
          lot of Rocket League prodigies out there. Most of them are parts of
          official teams, existing in all regions of the world, from America to
          Australia! Rocket League has three competitive mode: 3v3 Standard, 2v2
          Doubles, and 1v1 Duels. Each of these modes calibrates separately.
        </p>
        <p class="description-player">
          Like most games, Rocket League relies on a ranking system to represent
          player skill. Each rank, except for Supersonic Legend, contains three
          tiers, with each tier containing four divisions. This means you’ll
          have to clear all of a rank’s divisions before you’re able to move up
          to the next rank. Once you climb out of the third division of a
          particular rank, you’ll move to the next rank category.

          Psyonix had observed the popularity of Rocket League matches on Twitch
          and other live streaming platforms by early 2016 and were looking to
          use the game more in Esports. In March 2016, Psyonix announced the
          first Rocket League Championship Series; the finals took place in June
          2016 with a US$55,000 prize pool. The second season of the
          championship series took place in December 2016 with a $125,000 prize
          pool. A third series began in March 2017, with the $300,000 prize pool
          finals taking place three months later. In this season, two teams from
          the oceanic region were also invited to compete.
        </p>
        <p class="description-about-us">
          A second division, the Rocket League Rival Series (RLRS), was added in
          Season 4. The two teams finishing at the bottom of the RLCS and the
          two teams finishing at the top of the RLRS for each region play each
          other in a promotion tournament at the end of the season to determine
          if teams are promoted or relegated. At the advent of Season 5 in June
          2018, Psyonix organised and managed the event alone. Previous to this,
          they partnered with Twitch. Season 6 started in September 2018 and
          featured a $1,000,000 prize pool. For Season 7, Psyonix introduced
          South America as a new region. Season 8 took place in December 2019.
          The Season 9 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
          with winners of the regional championships being considered the
          champions. In July 2020, Psyonix announced a new format for the tenth
          season of RLCS, known as RLCS X. This format did away with league play
          and the RLRS in favor of teams earning points through three regional
          splits, all culminating in three seasonal majors.
        </p>
        <p class="description-about-us">
          The 2021–22 season began in October 2021, bringing in four new regions
          (Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific North, Asia Pacific South,
          and Sub-Saharan Africa), a more reliable circuit similar to Season X,
          and a $6 million prize pool.
